# Assignment 1 - Smart Financial Management system

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts utilizing **ipywidgets** to create interactive widgets for various financial and economic computations. Each script provides a different financial functionality using **Jupyter Notebook** and **IPython display widgets**.

## Contents
### 1. Loan Approval System
- Takes **income, employment status, and credit score** as inputs.
- Determines **loan approval** based on predefined conditions.
- Displays loan status and applicable interest rates.

### 2. Stock Risk Assessment
- Takes **stock returns** as input.
- Classifies stocks into **High, Medium, or Low Risk** categories.
- Uses a button to compute the risk level and display results.

### 3. Loan Repayment Tracker
- Simulates a **monthly loan repayment process**.
- Displays the **remaining balance** each month.
- Stops when the balance reaches zero.

### 4. Stock Price Monitoring
- Tracks stock prices from a predefined list.
- Ignores **missing values (None)**.
- Alerts when the stock price **reaches or exceeds PKR 200**.

### 5. Currency Exchange Rate Tracker
- Simulates **daily exchange rate tracking**.
- Starts at an initial rate of **PKR 290/USD** and increases until it reaches **PKR 300/USD**.

## Requirements
To run these scripts, ensure you have the following:
- Python installed (version 3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  ```sh
  pip install ipywidgets
  ```

## How to Run
1. Open Jupyter Notebook.
2. Load the respective `.ipynb` file.
3. Run the notebook cell by cell.
4. Interact with the widgets for real-time results.

## Usage
These interactive widgets help in:
- **Financial decision-making** (Loan approval, risk assessment)
